##The Maxima Project##

IMPORTANT: the compiler is currently down, we are switching from icarus verilog to verilator and in the meantime will be pushing breaking changes. sorry for the inconvenience!

This is an all in one IDE for Verilog development! 

Simply add the variables you would like to see in your waveform. Refer here for syntax: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/227684/how-to-create-vcd-file-or-simulation-activity-file-of-verilog-code

VCD files are the core to our project. Because of this, we need you to install Verilator: https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html#installation

for mac, brew install verilator
